Muppet is an open toolkit which standardizes the way you build, test, and deploy your MCPs. If MCP is the USB-C port for AI applications, think of Muppet as the assembly line that produces the USB-C port.

## Why Muppet?

Muppet is not a lib, it more of a collection of tools which you can use with [honojs](https://hono.dev/). Instead of reinventing the wheel, Muppet integrates with your hono app, and it just feels like a natural extension of your project.

The beauti about Muppet is not just the tools but the fact that you can use honojs with it. This means you can use all the features and capabilities of honojs with Muppet. Eg - Auth, CORS, Payments, Rate Limiting, etc.

This might not feel like a big deal, if you have a small and simple MCP, but as your project grows, you will start to appreciate the power of Muppet.

It's inspired by the [hono-openapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hono-openapi) package, so if you have used it before, you will find Muppet very familiar.
