You can create an MCP server from OpenAPI specs using the `fromOpenAPI` function. This function takes in the OpenAPI specs and generates the MCP server from it. This is useful if you have an existing OpenAPI spec, from any codebase and want to generate a MCP server from it.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="ts" code={fs.readFileSync("./content/docs/openapi/openapi-specs/example.ts", "utf-8")} />

<Callout>
    This will create all the routes as tools for the MCP server. Currently you cannot change this behavior but we are working on improving this in the future.
