import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

Setting up Muppet is super easy. We can set up the project, write code, develop with a local server, and deploy quickly. The same code will work on any runtime, just with different entry points. Let's look at the basic usage of Muppet.

## Starter

Starter templates are available for each platform. Use the following `create-muppet` command.

```bash tab="npm"
npm create muppet@latest my-app
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn create muppet my-app
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm create muppet@latest my-app
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun create muppet@latest my-app
```

```bash tab="deno"
deno init --npm muppet@latest my-app
```

Then you will be asked which transport layer and runtime you would like to use. The template will be pulled into `my-app`, so go to it and install the dependencies.

```bash tab="npm"
cd my-app
npm i
```

```bash tab="yarn"
cd my-app
yarn
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
cd my-app
pnpm i
```

```bash tab="bun"
cd my-app
bun i
```

Once the package installation is complete, run the following command to start up a local server.

```bash tab="npm"
npm run dev
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn dev
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dev
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun run dev
```

## Next Step

Now that you have a basic setup, you can start writing your code. The starter template will have a basic structure for you to follow. You can start by modifying the `src/index.ts` file and adding your own tools.

The final `export default` parts may vary from runtime to runtime, but all of the application code will run the same code everywhere.
