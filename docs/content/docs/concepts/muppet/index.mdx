## Muppet

Now that you have defined your tools and prompts, you can create the MCP instance of your app. This is done using the `muppet` function. This function takes the `app` instance and an configurtions object as arguments.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="ts" code={fs.readFileSync("./content/docs/concepts/muppet/example-muppet.ts", "utf-8")} />

The `muppet` function takes the following configurations

<TypeTable
  type={{
    name: {
      description: 'The name of the MCP server. This is used to identify the server by the MCP Client.',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
    },
    version: {
      description: 'The version of the MCP server. This is used to identify the server by the MCP Client.',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
    },
    logger: {
      description: 'A logger instance to use for logging. It uses pino under the hood, so you can use any pino compatible logger.',
      type: 'number',
    },
    resources: {
      type: "Record<string, ResourceFetcherFn>",
    },
    events: {
      type: "Emitter<ClientToServerNotifications>"
    }
  }}
/>

## Bridge

Now let's create a bridge between the LLM and your server. This is done using the `bridge` function. Think of this like [Bifr√∂st](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifr%C3%B6st), it connects the LLM using the [transport layer](/docs/concepts/transports) to your server.

This takes in your muppet instance and the transport layer you wanna use.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="ts" code={fs.readFileSync("./content/docs/concepts/muppet/example-bridge.ts", "utf-8")} />

You can check out other transport layers [here](/docs/concepts/transports).
