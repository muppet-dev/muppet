In this tutorial, we'll build a simple MCP weather server and connect it to a host, Claude for Desktop. We'll start with a basic setup, and then progress to more complex use cases.

This is the same tutorial as the one [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server) from the Model Context Protocol documentation. You can compare the two to see how Muppet simplifies the process of building and deploying MCPs.

## What we'll be building

Many LLMs do not currently have the ability to fetch the forecast and severe weather alerts. Let's use MCP to solve that!

We'll build a server that exposes two tools: `get-alerts` and `get-forecast`. Then we'll connect the server to an MCP host (in this case, Claude for Desktop):

<Steps>

<Step>
1. Create a hono.js project, for simplicity we will use nodejs runtime.

   ```bash
   pnpm create hono@latest my-mcp -i -t nodejs
   ```
</Step>
<Step>
2. Install the following packages

    ```bash
    pnpm add muppet @modelcontextprotocol/sdk @hono/standard-validator
    ```
