## Why Choose Muppet?

Muppet stands out by seamlessly integrating with the [Hono](https://hono.dev/) web framework. This integration allows you to enhance your existing Hono applications with MCP capabilities without the need for extensive rewrites. Muppet functions as a natural extension of Hono, providing an intuitive development experience.

## Key Use Cases

- **Enhance Existing Hono Applications:** Transform your current Hono app into a fully functional MCP server.
- **Develop New MCP Servers:** Build new MCP servers from scratch using Hono's robust framework.
- **OpenAPI-Based Development:** Create MCP servers guided by OpenAPI specifications for standardized API design.

## Advantages of Muppet

By leveraging Hono's features, Muppet enables you to incorporate essential functionalities into your MCP servers, such as:

- **Authentication:** Secure your MCP endpoints using Hono's authentication middleware.
- **CORS Management:** Effortlessly handle cross-origin requests.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protect your resources and ensure fair usage with built-in rate limiting.
- **Logging:** Monitor requests and responses using Hono's logging capabilities or integrate with third-party logging libraries.
- **Payment Integration:** Seamlessly incorporate billing and payment processes into your MCP workflows.

These features become increasingly valuable as your project scales, providing a robust foundation for efficient MCP management.

*Note: Muppet draws inspiration from the [hono-openapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hono-openapi) package. If you're familiar with `hono-openapi`, you'll find Muppet's design and philosophy comfortably aligned.*
