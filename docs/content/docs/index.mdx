Muppet is an open-source toolkit that streamlines the entire lifecycle of your MCPs - from development and testing to deployment.

## Why Muppet?

Muppet isn't just another library; it's a powerful collection of tools designed to seamlessly integrate with [Hono](https://hono.dev/). Instead of forcing you to rewrite your existing infrastructure, Muppet works *with* your Hono app, feeling like a natural and intuitive extension.

The real advantage of Muppet comes from its integration with Hono. This unlocks the full potential of Hono within your MCP, allowing you to easily add features like:

- **Authentication:** Secure your MCP endpoints with Hono's authentication middlewares.
- **CORS:** Manage cross-origin requests effortlessly.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protect your resources from abuse and ensure fair usage.
- **Payments:** Integrate billing and payments directly into your MCP workflows.

These features might seem insignificant for simple MCPs, but as your project grows in complexity and scale, Muppet's integration with Hono provides the robust foundation you'll need to manage your MCP efficiently.

Muppet draws inspiration from the [hono-openapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hono-openapi) package. If you're familiar with `hono-openapi`, you'll feel right at home with Muppet's design and philosophy.
