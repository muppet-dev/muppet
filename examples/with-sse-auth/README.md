# Muppet SSE Example with Auth using Hono

This example shows how to use the Muppet with SSE transport on Hono. We are using `SSEHonoTransport` transport layer from `muppet/streaming` to connect.

This can be used with all the runtimes which supports Streaming with hono. More details about that here - <https://hono.dev/docs/helpers/streaming>
